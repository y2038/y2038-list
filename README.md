## Kernels
Internal kernel timekeeping may break, timers, etc, could use a 32 bit signed timestamp, etc. 
### Linux
### Others

## Syscalls
Kernel Syscalls that deal with time may break. 
### Linux

## Core Libraries
Core libraries like GNU CoreUtils or LibC, etc, which may have time functions that could break. 
### Unix
### Others

## Databases 
Schema choices aside, many DBs have timestamp functions which may break. 

* MySQL
* Postgres
* MSSSQL
* SQLLite 

## Software
Email Servers, Calendars, Media Players... anything that uses timestamps might fall over. 

## Hardware
Is some hardware non-updatable and going to break?
